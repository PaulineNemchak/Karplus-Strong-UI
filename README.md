# ADC: Practical DSP and Audio Programming

We'll explore the concepts of Karplus Strong Synthesis. This is a physical modelling synthesis, aiming at modelling a plucked instrument such as a guitar. Included DSP will be noise generation, delay lines and filters. We'll also touch on MIDI messaging and polyphony.

We'll be using the Cmajor platform for the practical aspect of this workshop. Knowing Cmajor upfront is not a pre-requisite; we'll guide the participants through the implementation gently.

This will be a self-contained workshop aiming to be accessible to all levels of learning - all elements used in the practical part of the workshop will be thoroughly explained in the introduction.

## The Repo

In this repository, you'll find branches for each stage of the workshop:

* Part-1-MIDI
* Part-2-Delay
* Part-3-Filters
* Part-4-Polyphony

The main branch is the final code, with added unit test to accompany.
